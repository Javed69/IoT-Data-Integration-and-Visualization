# IoT-Data-Integration-and-Visualization



In this project, I designed and implemented an end-to-end IoT data processing and visualization solution using a stack of AWS services. The primary objective was to seamlessly collect, process, and gain actionable insights from IoT sensor data, ultimately improving operational efficiency.

# Key Achievements:

**Data Ingestion and Transformation**: I configured AWS IoT Core to securely collect data from IoT devices, ensuring reliable data ingestion. Raw data was then processed and transformed using AWS IoT Analytics, enabling real-time data cleansing, enrichment, and aggregation.

**Data Storage and Management**: Utilizing Amazon S3 as a central data repository, I designed an efficient storage structure that allowed for scalable data storage while ensuring data availability and durability.

**Serverless Data Processing**: Leveraging AWS Lambda, I implemented serverless data processing functions that executed seamlessly as data arrived, ensuring low-latency processing and cost-efficiency.

**Data Visualization**: I set up Grafana dashboards to visualize processed data in real-time, providing stakeholders with interactive and informative insights into system performance and IoT device behavior.
